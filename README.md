## Introduction

This comprehensive website was made to provide information regarding a fictional zombie apocalypse infecting 95% of the world's population. The target audience are the people of Ireland, one of the few remaining infection free zones. 

The idea for the site is based upon a fictional story, created by the developer. In this fictional world, COVID-19 has mutated upon coming into contact with a fungus named Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Nicknamed the "Zombie Ant Fungus") in Southern Thailand. This combination has produced a group of infected individuals which reselmble zombies with a hive mentaility and a hunger for flesh. The mutation has spread to all corners of the globe save for a few infection free zones, one of which is Ireland.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project is to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.
