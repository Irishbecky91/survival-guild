## Introduction

This comprehensive website was made to provide information regarding a fictional zombie apocalypse infecting 95% of the world's population. The target audience is the people of Ireland, one of the few remaining infection-free zones. 

The idea for the site is based upon a fictional story, created by the developer. In this fictional world, COVID-19 has mutated upon coming into contact with a fungus named Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Nicknamed the "Zombie Ant Fungus") in Southern Thailand. This combination has produced a group of infected individuals who resemble zombies with a hive mentality and a hunger for flesh. The mutation has spread to all corners of the globe save for a few infection-free zones, one of which is Ireland.

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

## UX
### Ideal User Demographic
The ideal user for this website is:
* Current user
* New user
* Survivalist

### User-Stories
#### Current User Goals
1. As a current user, I want to see regular updates to the information and breaking news on the home page as the situation develops.
2. As a current user, I want to easily navigate through the site and access the information I require with ease.
3. As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I have previously viewed within a small number of steps.

#### New User Goals
1. As a new user, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively. 
2. As a new user, I want the information I seek to be easily accessible and relevant.
3. As a new user, I want links directing me to additional sources of information and recommended stores to browse.
4. As a new user, I want attractive and relevant visuals and colour schemes that work with the content.

#### Survivalist Goals
1. As a survivalist, I want to factually correct and relevant information.
2. As a survivalist, I want to see instructional images and/or videos with user controls relevant to the information.
3. As a survivalist, I want to see links directing me to relevant sites where I can purchase items relevant to the information.

### Development-Planes
To create a comprehensive website that answers the above user stories and identifies the functionality of the site, the developer must develop all aspects of the fictional world for which the website is being created for. This includes a background story, a breaking news feed, survival information and creating a how-to-guide to dispose of infected individuals.

#### Strategy
Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:
- **Roles:**
    - Current users
    - New users
    - Experienced survivalists
    - Beginner survivalists

- **Demographic:**
    - All ages
    - Irish or residing in Ireland
    - Beginner to experienced Preppers/Survivalists

- **Psychographic:**
    - Lifestyles:
        - Interest in Nature
        - Active
    - Personality/Attitudes:
        - Outgoing
        - Focused
        - Creative
    - Values:
        - Environmentally friendly
        - Sense of community

The website needs to enable the **user** to:
- Retrieve the desired information:
    - Survival/hunting/gathering guide
    - Camp building and fortification guide
    - Backpack essentials
    - Infected disposal tips and techniques
    - Recommended equipment (hunting/tools/weapons/armor/etc.)
    - Report suspected cases for a referral.
    - Access links to additional sites where equipment, etc. can be purchased.
    
The website needs to enable the **site manager** to:
- Gather reports of suspected cases for a referral.
    
With the above information in mind, a strategy table was created to show the trade-offs between what is important and what is viable with the following results.

#### Scope
The scope plane is about defining requirements based on the goals established on the strategy plane. Using the information in the strategy plane, the identified required features have been broken into the following two categories.
- Content Requirements:
    - The user will be looking for:
        - Information on the global situation
        - Survival tips
        - Camp setup tips
        - Recommendations for equipment
        - Infected disposal tips and techniques
        - Backpack essentials
- Functionality Requirements:
    - The user will be able to:
        - Be able to easily navigate the site to find the information they require.
        - Ba able to find links to external sites, such as:
            - Sites where the user can purchase items
            - Sites with additional resources, such as knot tying videos
            - Sites with recipes for campfire cooking
        - Be able to contact the site to report possible cases

#### Structure
The information above is now organized in a hierarchial tree structure showing how users can navigate through the site with ease and efficiency, with the following results:
