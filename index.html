                    <h2>THE STATE OF THE WORLD</h2>
                    <p>On July 3rd 2021, the first case of a mutated strain of COVID-19 was discovered in Southern Thailand. It was found that when the virus came into contact with a fungus nicknamed the “zombie ant fungus” (Opiocordyceps unilateralis) it mutated into a new virus, named O-COVID-21.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Symptoms of O-COVID-21 in <span>Stage 1</span> include coughing, fever, hallucination, and rashes around the torso.</p> 
                    <p><span>Stage 2</span> symptoms include loss of balance, vomiting, loss of taste, nerve death which causes increased pain threshold, and sensitivity to light.</p>
                    <p><span>Stage 3</span> symptoms include increased levels of aggression, bleeding from the eyes and ears, loss of higher brain functions, insatiable appetite, increased muscle mass, hydrophobia and heliophobia. Beyond this stage, there are three known variations of infected individuals.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shortly after its discovery, the new mutation has spread to most countries across the world, causing widespread panic and hysteria. The virus appears to be fatal to the very young, very old or those with suppressed immune systems. Currently, all countries have shut their borders in an attempt to contain the virus.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Ireland is among the few remaining infection-free zones. The coast guard patrols the waters surrounding Ireland regularly, preventing all ships from landing.</p>
