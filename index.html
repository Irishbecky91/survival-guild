                    <h2>THE STATE OF THE WORLD</h2>
                    <p>On July 23rd 2021, the first case of a mutated strain of COVID-19 was discovered in Southern Thailand.  It was found that when the virus came into a fungus nicknamed the “zombie ant fungus” (Opiocordyceps unilateralis) it mutated into a new virus, named O-COVID-21.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shortly after it’s discovery, the new mutation has spread to most countries across the world, causing widespread panic and hysteria. The virus appears to cause extreme aggression and violence, and an aversion to light and water in all known cases. Currently, all countries have shut their borders  in an attempt to contain the virus.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ireland is among the few remaining infection free zones. The coast guard patrols the waters surrounding Ireland regularly, preventing all ships from landing.</p>
