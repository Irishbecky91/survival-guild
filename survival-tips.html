                        <h3>1. Military Tactical Backpack</h3>
                        <p>
                            Though it is not ideal, there is a good chance that you will be moving a lot during the apocalypse or at the very least going out for supplies, once you no longer have stuff in your bunker. This massive assault backpack can help you collect three days of supplies. The durable bag has a host of features that include heavy-duty zippers and utility-style cord pulls, Side and front load compression system.
                        </p>

                        <h3>2. Swiss Army Pocket Knife</h3>
                        <p>
                            Even at the moment, you should be carrying a Swiss Army Knife around as these handy multi-tools literally embody the “be prepared” mantra. Swiss Army Knives are easy to use and are mini mobile toolboxes that will allow you to tackle the task on the fly. A swiss army knife is a given during the apocalypse.
                        </p>

                        <h3>3. Water-resistant Torchlight</h3>
                        <p>
                            A tactical weapon like this should be in your arsenal. In this apocalyptic world, getting a hold of a light source will be no easy feat. Even more so, finding a long-lasting light source can mean the difference between life and death when out for supplies. Binwo’s Super Bright 2000 Lumen tactical light is a water-resistant light that is going to be godsent in the apocalypse.

                        <p>
                            One of the first things you need to do in a survival situation is to find shelter and water. However, you are not guaranteed a clean water source when you actually find one. The Lifesaver Water Filtration Filter Bottle Purifier kit could literally save your life removing 99.9% of viruses, chemicals, bacteria, etc.
                        </p>

                            Your safety out in the world will also be dependent on your ability to stay vigilant and see what is happening around you day and night. These compact binoculars will help you see at tremendous distances both in the day at night. But before you do so, make sure you find the high ground first.

                            Similar to the Swiss Army Knife, you should keep around a First Aid Kit to simply be prepared for the worse. Even more so, this First Aid Kit is Waterproof and can be easily transported. Hopefully, you will not have to treat any zombie bites in the near future.

                            You will not want to be lying around on the cold wet bare ground. Even more so, this can eventually end up exposing you to the elements causing you to get sick. A sleeping bag can also double as a temporary shelter.

                            Getting ahold of the right cords might seem like a small or easy feat, but it is not. Even more so finding a durable rope is tricky. A parachute cord like this can be used to string up a hammock, rig your sails, secure your tent or make an emergency tourniquet.

                            If you manage to catch any animals while you forage, you'll need the right knife to get the job done. A skinning knife will help seperate the meat and harvest the skin cleanly. It may even come in handy against an Infected.

                        <p>
                            One of the best tools to have is a utility shovel. Why have a regular shovel when you can have a shovel that's also a firestarter, compass, a knife, a saw and a tinder-holder. Having a utility shovel means you'll have every tool you need in one. Perfect for all your survival needs.

                        <h3>1. Starting A Fire</h3>
                        <p>
                            In order to build a fire there are a few things you will need. To build a fire you will need tinder, kindling and firewood. If it's raining, you may not be able to find dry tinder so keeping a good store of dry tinder in your backpack is a must.
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/site-images/fire-material.png" alt="Types of fire starting materials - Tinder, kindling and firewood" class="wide-image">
                        <ol class="main-list">
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Teepee Fire:</strong> This style is good for cooking. First, arrange your kindling in teepee fashion over your tinder. Then build a larger teepee of firewood over the kindling. When lit, the flames will rise up through the kindling and into the larger wood.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Lean-to Fire:</strong> This style is also good for cooking. Start by sticking a long piece of kindling into the ground above your tinder at about a 30-degree angle, with the other end of the stick pointing into the wind. Then lean smaller pieces of kindling against both sides of the longer piece to build a tent. As the kindling catches fire add more, followed by your firewood.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Cross Fire:</strong> This is ideal for a long-lasting fire. Start by laying your kindling over the tinder bed in a crisscross fashion, followed by your logs or firewood.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>The Log Cabin Fire:</strong> Another long-lasting fire. Begin by creating a kindling teepee over your tinder, then lay two logs on either side of the cone. Place two more logs on top of these to form a square. Then build up using smaller and shorter pieces of firewood until you've formed a cabin. Top off the cabin with some of your lightest kindling.
                            </li>
                        </ol>    
                        <br />

                        <h3>2. Purifying Water</h3>
                        <p>
                            More important than food, you will need water to survive the apocalypse. Here are four ways you can get clean drinking water in the wild. Just make sure you keep you backpack well stocked.
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/site-images/waterfall.png" alt="Image of a waterfall in the woods" class="wide-image">
                        <ol class="main-list">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Boiling:</strong> The easiest way to purify water is to boil it, provided you have the equipment to do so, plus a campfire or campstove. Bring water in a pot over a high heat until you have rolling bubbles, and let them roll for at least five minutes. Then let it cool down before drinking, or (duh) you'll scald your lips and tongue.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>Filtration or Purification Pumps:</strong> If you go to a camping and outdoors supply store, you'll undoubtedly find many different kinds of pumps with filters and purifiers to make sure non-potable water goes in, but drinkable water comes out - right into your water bottle. This is done through a process of squeezing water through ceramic or charcoal filter and treating it with chemicals. Some hi-tech water bottles have this process built into them, so that you don't need to pump water into a separate one; the purification process happens as you squeeze or suck water directly into your mouth.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>Purification Drops and Tablets:</strong> A simple and inexpensive - but not necessarily the best tasting - method of purifying wild water is by dropping in a couple of purification tablets or drops. The most common chemical used is iodine, but chlorine or potassium permanganate are also effective. Let the chemicals treat the water for at least 20 minutes before consuming, and mix it with powdered mixes to mask any of its taste.
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li>
                                <strong>Make an evaporation trap in the ground:</strong> All of the previous methods require you to carry water or have a water source nearby - but what if you don't have any? According to NatureSkills.com, you can pull moisture out of the earth by digging a hole in the ground and inserting a container on the bottom. Cover the hole with plastic so that no moisture escapes, and put a small weight (a rock perhaps) in the center of the cover so that there's a dip in the center. When the water evaporates from the ground upwards, it condenses on the cover and drips down into the container.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
